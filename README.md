# Dragon Shield – Personal Asset Management 🐉🛡️

**Version 4.7.1** | September 13th, 2025

Dragon Shield is a native macOS application for private investors to track, analyze and document all assets entirely offline. Every byte of financial data remains on your Mac, encrypted in a local database—no cloud, no telemetry.

The app follows Apple's best-in-class UX conventions while embracing ZEN-minimalism for clarity and focus.
For detailed interface guidelines, see the [Dragon Shield UI/UX Design Guide](DragonShield/docs/UX_UI_concept/dragon_shield_ui_guide.md).

## ✨ Feature Overview

- **Local-first & private**: Data stays on-device and is encrypted with SQLCipher (AES-256). All analytics run locally via Swift and Python helpers.
- **Configurable dashboard**: Drag, drop, and persist custom tile layouts (accounts needing updates, upcoming alerts, strict unused/unthemed instruments, top positions, crypto top 5, themes overview, currency exposure, risk buckets, etc.) with a shared tile style (`View+DashboardTileStyle`).
- **Alerts cockpit**: The Alerts & Events area combines a severity-filtered timeline (Charts-based), trigger-type chips, rich detail table, and a startup popup that surfaces near-term deadlines.
- **Portfolio & instrument management**: Maintain institutions, accounts, instruments, portfolio themes, and tags using the new floating search pickers and autosaving table layouts; column widths persist across sessions.
- **Transactions journal**: Record buy/sell trades with the two-leg `Trade` + `TradeLeg` schema, validation, holdings preview, and history view (Release 4.7.1).
- **Import & maintenance tooling**: Python utilities parse CSV/XLSX/PDF statements (e.g. Credit Suisse), refresh FX & instrument prices, and perform encrypted database backup/restore. Settings export also generates the read-only SQLite snapshot used by the iOS viewer prototype.

### In Design / Planned
- Alerts timeline narrative mode and AI-assisted summaries (`docs/new_alerts_timeline_tab.md`).
- Ichimoku Dragon momentum scanner pipeline (`docs/IchimokuDragon/`).
- Touch ID-secured key management & notarised macOS build.
- Options valuation models and what-if rebalancing.
- Signed public beta and iOS companion (Phase 1 read-only viewer via snapshot import).


## 🐉 Ichimoku Dragon Market Scanner

The new **Ichimoku Dragon** module automates daily scans of S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 constituents using full Ichimoku Kinko Hyo analytics.

- Pulls up to 300 days of history per ticker from Yahoo Finance (Finnhub fallback planned).
- Computes Tenkan, Kijun, cloud spans and regression-based slopes to rank top momentum candidates.
- Tracks open positions, raises sell alerts when price closes below the Kijun Sen and logs every pipeline run.
- Provides a dedicated SwiftUI dashboard with watchlist, alert center, history browser and configurable schedule (default 22:00 Europe/London).
- Generates a daily CSV report stored under `~/Library/Application Support/DragonShield/IchimokuReports`.

See `docs/IchimokuDragon/user_guide.md` for the workflow and screen tour.

## 🚧 Current Status & Roadmap

Highlights from the latest iterations:

### Delivered
- Dashboard tile system with autosaved layouts, FX/price update actions, and upcoming-alert popups on launch.
- Alerts settings + timeline rebuild (Charts-based) with severity filters, trigger chips, and detailed table view.
- Portfolio themes workspace, strict unused/unthemed instrument reports, and floating search pickers across forms.
- Transactions journal (Trade/TradeLeg schema) with holdings preview, validation, and history view (Release 4.7.1).
- Database tooling: dbmate migrations, encrypted backup/restore, import sessions, and Settings → Data Export snapshot for the iOS viewer prototype.

### In Progress
- CSV/XLSX import refinement and alert timeline UX follow-up (`docs/new_alerts_timeline_tab.md`).
- Research spikes for the Ichimoku Dragon scanner (models/services under `DragonShield/Ichimoku`).

### Next Up
- Touch ID-secured key storage and notarised macOS build pipeline.
- Options pricing experiments and rebalancing workflow.
- Expanded PDF import coverage & automation.
- Signed public beta and packaged iOS read-only client via snapshot export.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Swift / SwiftUI (+ Charts)
- **Backend Logic**: Python 3.11 (parsing, analytics)
- **Database**: Encrypted SQLite (SQLCipher v4)
- **Build Tools**: Xcode 15+, SwiftPM, Python venv
- **Swift⇄Python Bridge**: CLI invocation (Swift spawns Python scripts)

Note: runtime Python scripts used by the app are bundled under `DragonShield/python_scripts/`.
Repo tooling (release/CI/helpers) lives under `scripts/`.

## 🚀 Getting Started / Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd DragonShieldNG
   ```

2. **Create Python virtual environment (outside of the `DragonShield` app folder)**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv python_scripts_venv
   ```

3. **Activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   source python_scripts_venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

5. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   dbmate --migrations-dir DragonShield/db/migrations --url "sqlite:DragonShield/dragonshield.sqlite" up
   ```
6. **Open the Xcode project**
   ```bash
   open DragonShield.xcodeproj
   ```
7. **Build & run**
   - Select DragonShield → My Mac and press ⌘R

> **⚠️ Important**: The current build is developer-only. Replace the default DB key with a Keychain-managed key before storing real data.

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit tests live in the `DragonShieldTests` target (e.g. floating search picker, autosave table helpers).
- The bundled schemes (`DragonShield`, `DragonShield iOS`) do not include a Test action by default. Add one via **Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme…** (or duplicate a scheme) before running `xcodebuild test`.
- Once the Test action is enabled you can exercise the suite from Xcode or the CLI, for example:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild test -scheme DragonShield -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64'
  ```
- Tests rely on macOS 14+/Xcode 15+ for SwiftUI + Charts APIs.

## 💾 Database Information

- **Type**: SQLite
- **Production Folder**: `/Users/renekeller/Library/Containers/com.rene.DragonShield/Data/Library/Application Support/DragonShield`
  - Primary database: `dragonshield.sqlite`
  - Test database: `dragonshield_test.sqlite`
  - Backup directory: `Dragonshield DB Backup` (full, reference and transaction backups)
  - Apply migrations with `dbmate --migrations-dir DragonShield/db/migrations --url "$DATABASE_URL" up`.
  - Full database backup/restore via `python3 python_scripts/backup_restore.py`
- **Encryption**: SQLCipher (AES-256)
- **Migrations**: `DragonShield/db/migrations`
- **Dev Key**: Temporary; do not use for production data

### Export Snapshot for iOS
Use Settings → **Export to iCloud Drive…** to generate a consistent read‑only `DragonShield_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.sqlite` file. Import the file in the iOS app via the Files app on your iPhone.

## Updating the Database

Run dbmate to apply migrations and copy the database to the container's Application Support folder. The command prints the applied versions and final path:

```bash
dbmate --migrations-dir DragonShield/db/migrations --url "$DATABASE_URL" up
```

### ZKB CSV Import
Drag a `Depotauszug*.csv` file onto the **Import ZKB Statement** zone in the Data Import/Export view or use *Select File* to choose it manually. The parser maps all rows to the PositionReports table.


### GPT Shell
A small CLI to experiment with OpenAI function calls. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment.

```bash
python3 python_scripts/gpt_shell.py list
python3 python_scripts/gpt_shell.py schema echo
python3 python_scripts/gpt_shell.py call echo '{"text": "hello"}'
```
## 💡 Usage

At present the application must be run from Xcode. Future releases will ship a signed & notarized .app bundle.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

See [DragonShield/docs/troubleshooting.md](DragonShield/docs/troubleshooting.md) for solutions to common issues. This includes the harmless
`default.metallib` warning printed by the Metal framework on some systems.

## Thesis Management (v1.2) quick start
- Run: open the macOS app target in Xcode and navigate to Sidebar → Thesis Mgmt. From the dashboard, hit “Review” on any card to enter focus mode; detail tabs cover Trends, History, KPIs, and LLM import/export.
- Tests: `xcodebuild -scheme DragonShield -destination 'platform=macOS' test -only-testing:DragonShieldTests/ThesisManagementTests`
